Broadcom BCM63138 DSL System-on-a-Chip device tree bindings
-----------------------------------------------------------

Boards compatible with the BCM63138 DSL System-on-a-Chip should have the
following properties:

Required root node property:

compatible: should be "brcm,bcm63138"

reboot
------
Two nodes are required for software reboot: a timer node and a syscon-reboot node.

Timer node:

- compatible: Must be "brcm,bcm6328-timer", "syscon"
- reg: Register base address and length

Syscon reboot node:

See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/reset/syscon-reboot.txt for the
detailed list of properties, the two values defined below are specific to the
BCM6328-style timer:

- offset: Should be 0x34 to denote the offset of the TIMER_WD_TIMER_RESET register
  from the beginning of the TIMER block
- mask: Should be 1 for the SoftRst bit.

Example:

	timer: timer@80 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm6328-timer", "syscon";
		reg = <0x80 0x3c>;
	};

	reboot {
		compatible = "syscon-reboot";
		regmap = <&timer>;
		offset = <0x34>;
		mask = <0x1>;
	};
