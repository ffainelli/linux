Broadcom BCM63138/48 DSL System-on-a-Chip device tree bindings
-----------------------------------------------------------

Boards compatible with the BCM63138 or BCM63148 DSL System-on-a-Chip should
have the following properties:

Required root node property:

compatible: should be one of:
	    "brcm,bcm63138"
	    "brcm,bcm63148"

An optional Boot lookup table Device Tree node is required for secondary CPU
initialization as well as a 'resets' phandle to the correct PMB controller as
defined in reset/brcm,bcm63138-pmb.txt for this secondary CPU, and an
'enable-method' property.

Required properties for the Boot lookup table node:
- compatible: should be "brcm,bcm63138-bootlut"
- reg: register base address and length for the Boot Lookup table

Optional properties for the primary CPU node:
- enable-method: should be one of:
		 "brcm,bcm63138" for BCM63138
		 "brcm,brahma-b15" for BCM63148


Optional properties for the secondary CPU node:
- enable-method: should be one of:
		 "brcm,bcm63138" for BCM63138
		 "brcm,brahma-b15" for BCM63148
- resets: phandle to the relevant PMB controller, one integer indicating the internal
  bus number, and a second integer indicating the address of the CPU in the PMB
  internal bus number. This property is only required for BCM63138

Example:

	cpus {
		cpu@0 {
			compatible = "arm,cotex-a9";
			reg = <0>;
			...
			enable-method = "brcm,bcm63138";
		};

		cpu@1 {
			compatible = "arm,cortex-a9";
			reg = <1>;
			...
			enable-method = "brcm,bcm63138";
			resets = <&pmb0 4 1>;
		};
	};

	bootlut: bootlut@8000 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm63138-bootlut";
		reg = <0x8000 0x50>;
	};

=======
reboot
------
Two nodes are required for software reboot: a timer node and a syscon-reboot node.

Timer node:

- compatible: Must be "brcm,bcm6328-timer", "syscon"
- reg: Register base address and length

Syscon reboot node:

See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/reset/syscon-reboot.txt for the
detailed list of properties, the two values defined below are specific to the
BCM6328-style timer:

- offset: Should be 0x34 to denote the offset of the TIMER_WD_TIMER_RESET register
  from the beginning of the TIMER block
- mask: Should be 1 for the SoftRst bit.

Example:

	timer: timer@80 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm6328-timer", "syscon";
		reg = <0x80 0x3c>;
	};

	reboot {
		compatible = "syscon-reboot";
		regmap = <&timer>;
		offset = <0x34>;
		mask = <0x1>;
	};
